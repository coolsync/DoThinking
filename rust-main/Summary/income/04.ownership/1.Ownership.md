## [Ownership](#what-is-ownership)



### 1 [The Stack and the Heap](#the-stack-and-the-heap)



### 2 [Ownership Rules](#ownership-rules)

- Each value in Rust has a variable thatâ€™s called its *owner*.
- There can only be one owner at a time.
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

#### [Ways Variables and Data Interact: Clone](#ways-variables-and-data-interact-clone)



#### [Stack-Only Data: Copy](#stack-only-data-copy)

Here are some of the types that implement `Copy`:

- All the integer types, such as `u32`.
- The Boolean type, `bool`, with values `true` and `false`.
- All the floating point types, such as `f64`.
- The character type, `char`.
- Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement `Copy`. For example, `(i32, i32)` implements `Copy`, but `(i32, String)` does not.
