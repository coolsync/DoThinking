# [Custom Types](https://rustwiki.org/en/rust-by-example/custom_types.html#custom-types)

Rust custom data types are formed mainly through the two keywords:

- `struct`: define a structure
- `enum`: define an enumeration

Constants can also be created via the `const` and `static` keywords.



- Tuple structs, which are, basically, named tuples. 
- The classic [C structs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language))
- Unit structs, which are field-less, are useful for generics.
